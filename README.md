# Continuous Integration (CI) Laravel GitHub Action Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a ready-to-use GitHub Actions configuration for continuous integration (CI) with Laravel applications. It streamlines the process of setting up automated testing and deployment workflows for your Laravel project using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

### Locate the Workflow File
The main GitHub Actions workflow file can be found at:

```
.github/workflows/laravel.yml
```

This file contains the configuration for running CI pipeline, including setting up the environment, running tests, and other necessary steps.

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Update PHP Version:** Adjust the PHP version in the workflow file according to your project's requirements.

2. **Environment Variables:** Set any required environment variables in your GitHub repository's settings under "Secrets" to ensure your tests run with the appropriate configurations.

3. **Dependencies:** Make sure your composer.json file includes all necessary dependencies for your tests.

4. **Test Commands:** Verify the test commands in the workflow file match those used in your Laravel application. Modify them if needed.

### Usage

**Push Changes:** Once you push changes to your repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run and execute the CI pipeline.

**Monitor Results:** Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress and results of your CI pipeline.
